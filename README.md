# SABR
This repo contains all source code for implementing network assisted adaptive bitrate video streaming and evaluating the system in the CloudLab testbed

## About this system
This system has been tested and evaluated in [CloudLab](https://www.cloudlab.us/), a testbed for researchers to build and test clouds and new architectures.
In order to experiment with CloudLab, you will need an account for access and a profile to instantiate. The profile is specified here as <i>cloudlab_topo.rspec</i>

The following subsystems are included:

## Controller and SABR
